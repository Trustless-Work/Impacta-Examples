# Impacta Bootcamp by Stellar – Example Projects

This repository contains example projects, demos, and reference implementations used during the Impacta Bootcamp by Stellar, delivered in collaboration with the Blockchain Acceleration Foundation (BAF).

The goal of this repository is to provide practical material for developers learning how to build on the Stellar ecosystem, with a focus on Soroban smart contracts and real-world blockchain applications.

---

## Purpose

This repository was created to:

- Provide structured reference implementations used during the bootcamp
- Help students review contract architecture and best practices
- Serve as a starting point for hackathons and production-oriented projects
- Demonstrate real use cases built on Stellar

All examples are designed to balance educational clarity with practical development patterns.

---

## What You’ll Find Here

Depending on the edition of the bootcamp, this repository may include:

- Basic Soroban contract structures
- Storage pattern examples
- Testing with `soroban_sdk`
- Smart contract modularization
- Backend integrations (e.g., NestJS)
- Frontend integrations (e.g., Next.js / React)
- Token integrations (including USDC on Stellar)
- Hackathon-ready templates

Each project folder may contain its own documentation when necessary.

---

## Tech Stack

Most examples are built using:

- Rust + soroban_sdk  
- Stellar CLI  
- Node.js / TypeScript  
- NestJS  
- Next.js / React  
- Docker (when required)

---

## Who Is This For?

This repository is intended for:

- Developers new to Stellar
- Builders learning Soroban smart contracts
- Hackathon participants
- Students exploring Web3 infrastructure
- Developers transitioning from EVM to Stellar

## Learning Philosophy

We believe the best way to learn smart contract development is by building.  
Security, optimization, and architecture should be part of the learning process from day one.  
Open source collaboration accelerates ecosystem growth.

---

## Disclaimer

These projects are primarily educational examples.  
They may not be production-ready unless explicitly stated.  

Always perform proper testing and security reviews before deploying contracts to mainnet.

Collaboration and experimentation are welcome.
